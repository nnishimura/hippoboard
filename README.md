# hippoboard

hippoboard is a simple and minimal kanban tool. This repo contains the following micro services for the app:

| | |
|-|-|
| /ui     | Angular frontend                             |
| /api    | Golang REST API                              |
| /server | terraform & ansible provisioning for servers |


## User stories & Plans
* W1: as a dev, I can deploy ui/api to public websites with basic auth.
* W2: as a user, I can create a task (both api/ui). / TODO: Research the go project structure best practices
* W3: remaining UIs, finish up
* Due: June 25th
